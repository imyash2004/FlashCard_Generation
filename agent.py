Create exactly 10-12 high-quality flashcards from the following educational content.

STRICT FORMATTING RULES:
- Start each question with "Q:" on its own line
- Start each answer with "A:" on its own line  
- Leave a blank line between each flashcard
- Do not number the questions

Example format:
Q: What is photosynthesis?
A: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

Q: What are the main products of photosynthesis?
A: The main products are glucose and oxygen.

Guidelines:
- Make questions clear and specific
- Make answers complete but concise (1-3 sentences)
- Cover key concepts, definitions, and important facts
- Vary question types: definitions, explanations, applications

Text to analyze:
{text[:3000]}
